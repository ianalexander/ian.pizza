The service allows for 15 second videos, stylistic filters, and native integration into the existing Instagram platform.</p>
<p>Time will tell how successful Instagram for Facebook is, but in the meantime we can look back on Facebook’s product history. This is not meant to be a “Facebook sucks” post, there are many quality of pieces of innovation in this list including the Facebook Open Graph Platform, Likes, and Timeline.</p>
<p>This history of products gives us a chance to review product development at Facebook and identify some of the trends that may make a product successful or not.</p>

<h2 id="Observations"><a href="#Observations" class="headerlink" title="Observations"></a>Observations</h2><p>From 2006 to 2012, <strong>Innovative products at Facebook have greatly outperformed their clone counterparts</strong>. Innovative products performed approximately 66% better than cloned products. Likes, Timeline, Open Graph have all been long-lived and successful. Marketplace, Places, and Deals have suffered (current data suggests Poke will have the same fate). <strong>From 2006 to 2012, Facebook never launched a clone that has not been discontinued.</strong></p>
<p>But not all innovative products are successful, Beacon and Credits both met an unfortunate end. Data suggests Facebook Home will head to the wayside as well.</p>
<p>As we watch Facebook unveil it’s latest Vine clone, data suggests that this product may struggle to grow as quickly as its counterparts.</p>
